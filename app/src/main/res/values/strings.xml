        This app is designed to let the operating system sort contacts in the right order, by
        updating phonetic names and types of your contacts.
    </string>

        How this works:

        \n\Update for Chinese contacts: Phonetic name is Pinyin, which will be translated from the
        contact name. Phonetic type is PINYIN. So that system will use phonetic last name to
        determine the order.

        \n\nUpdate for Latin contacts: Phonetic name and type will be removed. So that system will
        use contact first name to determine the order.

        \n\Remove all phonetic data: For Android 7.0 above, the system seems can handle Chinese name
        correctly. You may want to try to clear phonetic data. However, the benefit of using
        phonetic data is that they can be synced across devices and benefit all of them.
